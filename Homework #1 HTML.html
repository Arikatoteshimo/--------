      <b>HTML</b> 3.2 was published as W3C Recommendation. it was the first
      version developed and <br />
      standardized exclusively by the <b>W3C</b> as the <b>IETF</b> had closed
      its <b>HTML Working Group</b> on September <br />
      12, 1996.Initially code-named <q>Wilbur</q>, <b>HTML</b> 3.2 dropped math
      formulas entirely, reconciled overlap<br />
      among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual
      markup tags. <b>Netscape's</b><br />
      <b>blink</b> element and <b>Microsoft's</b> marquee element were omitted
      due to a mutual agreement between the
      <br />
      two companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A markup for mathematical formulas simalar to that in HTML was not
      standardized until 14 months laten in <br />
      MathML.
